# ADAS-simulation 辅助驾驶模拟
## this Project implements some ADAS functions in Tronis simulation environment
•	Implement lane detection, lane keeping, adaptive cruise control based on OpenCV in C++

•	Used canny edge detection, Hough transform for lane line detection

•	Used PID control to control the throttle and steering

•	Realized that the self-driving car can drive stably along the lane line at a high speed at curves in the tronis simulation scene, and follow the car in front in a stable distance
